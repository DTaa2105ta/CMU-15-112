# **CMU 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science**

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I document my journey through CMU 15-112. This course covers the core concepts of programming and computer science, and I have included my knowledge, code, and homework assignments.

About the Course
CMU 15-112 is designed to teach fundamental programming and problem-solving skills. The course covers a variety of topics, including:

- Write clear, robust, and efficient code in Python using:
  - sequential, conditional, and loop statements
  - strings, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
  - objects and classes
  - recursive approaches
  - graphics and interaction
- Develop programs to effectively solve medium-sized tasks by:
  - employing modular, top-down design in program construction
  - demonstrating an effective programming style based on established standards, practices, and guidelines
  - proactively creating and writing test cases to test and debug code
  - applying computational problem-solving skills to new problems, especially in the student's home academic discipline
  - explaining and analyzing the efficiency of algorithms, particularly by predicting the Big-O running time of small pieces of code
- Design and write a substantial (500-1500 line) program in Python with minimal guidance
