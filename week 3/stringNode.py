# 1. Four kinds of quotes
# Quotes enclose characters to tell Python "this is a string!"
# single-quoted or double-quoted strings are the most common
print('single-quotes')
print("double-quotes")

# triple-quoted strings are less common (though see next section for a typical use)
print('''triple single-quotes''')
print("""triple double-quotes""")

# The reason we have multiple kinds of quotes is partly so we can have strings like:
print('The professor said "No laptops in class!" I miss my laptop.')

# 2. Newlines in strings
print("""\
You can use a backslash at the end of a line in a string to exclude
the newline after it. This should almost never be used, but one good
use of it is in this example, at the start of a multi-line string, so
the whole string can be entered with the same indentation (none, that is).
""")

print("abc\ndef")  # \n is a single newline character.
print("""abc
def""")

# 3. More Escape Sequence
print("Double-quote: \"")
print("Backslash: \\")
print("Newline (in brackets): [\n]")
print("Tab (in brackets): [\t]")

print("These items are tab-delimited, 3-per-line:")
print("abc\tdef\tg\nhi\tj\\\tk\n---")

## An escape sequence produces a single character
s = "a\\b\"c\td"
print("s =", s)
print("len(s) =", len(s))

# 4. repr() vs print()
## print() is meants to produce output intended for user
## repr() shows a representation of the data contained in the string
print("These look the same when we print them!")
s1="abc\tdef"
s2="abc  def"

print("print s1: ",s1)
print("print s2: ",s2)
print("\nThey aren't really though...")
print("s1==s2?", s1==s2)

print("\nLet's try repr instead")
print("repr s1: ",repr(s1))
print("repr s2: ",repr(s2))

print("\nHere's a sneaky one")
s1="abcdef"
s2="abcdef             \t"

print("print s1: ",s1)
print("print s2: ",s2)

print("s1==s2?", s1==s2)

print("repr s1: ",repr(s1))
print("repr s2: ",repr(s2))
print("repr() lets you see the spaces^^^")

# 5. String Literals as Multi-line Comments
"""
Python does not have multiline comments, but you can do something similar
by using a top-level multiline string, such as this. Technically, this is
not a comment, and Python will evaluate this string, but then ignore it
and garbage collect it!
"""
print("wow!")

# 6. Some String Constans
import string
print(string.ascii_letters)   # abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
print(string.ascii_lowercase) # abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
print("-----------")
print(string.ascii_uppercase) # ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
print(string.digits)          # 0123456789
print("-----------")
print(string.punctuation)     # '!"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~'
print(string.printable)       # digits + letters + punctuation + whitespace
print("-----------")
print(string.whitespace) 

# 7. String Operators
## String + and *
print("abc" + "def")  # What do you think this should do?
print("abc" * 3)  # How many characters do you think this prints?
#print("abc" + 3)  # ...will this give us an error? (Yes)

## The in operator
print("ring" in "strings")
print("wow" in "amazing!")
print("Yes" in "yes!")
print("" in "No way!")

# 8. String indexing and slicing
## 8.1 Indexing a single character 
# Indexing lets us find a character at a specific location (the index)
s = "abcdefgh"
print(s)
print(s[0])
print(s[1])
print(s[2])

print("-----------")
print("Length of ",s,"is",len(s))

print("-----------")
print(s[len(s)-1])
#print(s[len(s)])  # crashes (string index out of range)
## Negative indexes 
s = "abcdefgh"
print(s)
print(s[-1])
print(s[-2])
## Slicing a range of character 
print(s)
print(s[0:3])
print(s[1:3])
print("-----------")
print(s[2:3])
print(s[3:3])
## Slicing with default parameters 
s = "abcdefgh"
print(s)
print(s[3:])
print(s[:3])
print(s[:])
## Slicing with a step paramter 
print("This is not as common, but perfectly ok.")
s = "abcdefgh"
print(s)
print(s[1:7:2])
print(s[1:7:3])
print(s[3::-1])
## Reversing a string
s = "abcdefgh"

print("This works, but is confusing:")
print(s[::-1])

print("This also works, but is still confusing:")
print(reversed(s))
print("".join(reversed(s)))

print("Best way: write your own reverseString() function:")

def reverseString(s):
    return s[::-1]

print(reverseString(s)) # crystal clear!

# 9. Looping over Strings
## "for" loop with indexes
s = "abcd"
for i in range(len(s)):
    print(i, s[i])
## "for" loop withour indexes
s = "abcd"
for c in s:
    print(c)
## "for" loop with split
# By itself, names.split(",") produces something called a list.
# Until we learn about lists (soon!), do not store the result of
# split() and do not index into that result.  Just loop over the
# result, as shown here:

names = "fred,wilma,betty,barney"
for name in names.split(","):
    print(name)
## "for" loop with splitlines
# splitlines() also makes a list, so only loop over its results,
# just like split():

# 11. Strings are IMMUTABLE
## You cannot change strings! They are immutable
s = 'abcde'

## Instead, you must create a new string
s = "abcde"
s = s[:2] + "z" + s[3:]

# 12. Strings and Aliases
## Strings are immutable, so aliases do not change!
s = 'abc' # s references the string 'abc'
t = s     # t is an alias to the one-and-only string 'abc'
s += 'def'

## str() and len()
### name = input("Enter your name: ")
### print("Hi, " + name + ". Your name has " + str(len(name)) + " letters!")
## chr() and ord()
print(ord("A")) # 65
print(chr(65))  # "A"

## eval()
